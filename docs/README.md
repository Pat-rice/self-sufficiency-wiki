# self-sufficiency-wiki
A knowledge base to help becoming self sufficient

**Warning:** I do a lot of copy/paste as I don't have enough time to rewrite everything. I don't quote sources as they are too many and diverse (pdfs, books, websites, people...) I'm only indexing content, and make it available freely. If I copied some of your content and you're not happy with it, I can delete it.
